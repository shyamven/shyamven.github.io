I am the Head of Technical Staff at [Anthrogen](https://www.anthrogen.com/).

I am on leave from Duke University, where I am a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, advised by [Vahid Tarokh](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/vahid-tarokh). My research interests are broadly in deep learning and information theory.

Previously, I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from UCLA, where I worked on several projects involving high-performance spatially coupled (SC) codes as part of the [Laboratory for Robust Information Systems (LORIS)](https://loris.seas.ucla.edu/). My work at UCLA was supervised by [Lara Dolecek](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/lara-dolecek/).
