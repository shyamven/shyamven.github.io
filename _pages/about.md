I am a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Duke University, advised by [Prof. Vahid Tarokh](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/vahid-tarokh). My research broadly focuses on designing and optimizing neural network architectures for applications in signal processing, computer vision, and natural language processing.

Previously, I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from UCLA, where I worked on several projects involving high-performance spatially coupled (SC) codes as part of the [Laboratory for Robust Information Systems (LORIS)](https://loris.seas.ucla.edu/). My work at UCLA was supervised by [Prof. Lara Dolecek](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/lara-dolecek/).
